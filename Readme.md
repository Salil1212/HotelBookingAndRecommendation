 Hotel Booking & Recommendation Application

This project is a hotel booking and recommendation application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It allows users to register, login, view hotels, manage bookings, and receive recommendations based on their activities.

 Features

- User registration and authentication using JWT tokens
- Hotel listing with options to visit, draft, and complete bookings
- Activities tracking for visits, draft bookings, and completed bookings
- Hotel descriptions for detailed information
- Responsive design for both mobile and desktop views
- Logout functionality to securely end user sessions

 Technologies Used

- Frontend:
  - React.js
  - Axios for HTTP requests
  - React Router for routing
  - Bootstrap for styling

- Backend:
  - Node.js with Express.js
  - MongoDB for database storage
  - JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication


 Setup Instructions

 Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed globally
- MongoDB installed locally or on a cloud service (adjust `.env` file accordingly)

 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd hotel-booking-recommendation
   ```

2. Setup Backend:

   ```bash
    Navigate to server directory
   cd server

    Install dependencies
   npm install

    Start the server (development mode)
   npm run dev
   ```

   The backend server should start at `http://localhost:5000`.

3. Setup Frontend:

   ```bash
    Navigate to frontend directory
   cd ../frontend

    Install dependencies
   npm install

    Start the frontend server
   npm start
   ```

   The frontend development server should start at `http://localhost:3000`.

 Usage

- Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
- If you are a new user, click on "Register" and follow the instructions to create an account.
- After registration/login, you will be redirected to the hotel listing page (`/hotels`).
- View hotel details, read descriptions, and interact with booking options (visit, draft, complete).
- Logout using the logout button to securely end your session.

 Additional Notes

- This project uses JWT for authentication. Ensure you have the `.env` file set up with a `JWT_SECRET` key.
- Adjust MongoDB connection URI in the backend configuration (`server/config/db.js`) as per your setup.
- Customize the application as per your requirements, adding features like user management, additional hotel details, and more.
